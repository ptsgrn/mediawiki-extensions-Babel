== Babel 2017.07 ==
Released at 2017-07-26.

=== Noteworthy changes ===
* Information about the languages that the user knows is now cached to improve
performance. To load the data from the cache, use getCachedUserLanguageInfo()
instead of getUserLanguageInfo(), and getCachedUserLanguages() instead of
getUserLanguages().
* Language code are normalized when they are stored in the database. So, for
example, "ZH" and "zh" are now stored as the same code.
* It is now possible to load Babel information from a Babel box on a global
user page.
